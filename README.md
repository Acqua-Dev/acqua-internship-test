# Acqua Internship Coding Challenge

Welcome to Acqua's coding challenge designed for aspiring interns! This challenge is your opportunity to make a splash and show us the depth of your abilities. Dive into the tasks and let your skills flow like water.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you embark on this adventure, make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system. It's the current wave in JavaScript runtimes!

### Steps to Set Up Your Local Environment
1. **Fork the Repository**
    - To start, fork the repository to your GitHub account, creating your personal development sea where you can freely swim around the code.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[RepoName].git
   ```
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your GitHub username. 
   - Replace `[RepoName]` with the name of the repository.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd [RepoName]
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

## Development Setup

### Running the Development Server
To see your changes ripple through in real-time, run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

## Challenge Tasks

These tasks are designed to evaluate your ability to navigate through code like a fish through water:

1. **Implement Persistent State Management**
    - Currently, our application's memory is as short as a goldfish's; it forgets everything when you refresh! Your task is to integrate a state management library to help it remember. We suggest using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for its simplicity and effectiveness.

2. **Develop Intelligent Functionality with AI Integration**
    - The current SmartBar is like a fish out of water when it comes to being smart. We want it to be as sharp as a swordfish! Integrate the [OpenAI GPT API](https://beta.openai.com/) to enhance this functionality. Your mission is to create a prompt that takes the `todoList` and `doneList`, analyzes user input, and intelligently updates the lists.
    - **üí° Hint**: You guessed it! We don't expect you to make a SmartBar that can predict the future. Start by creating a simple prompt that can move items between the `todoList` and `doneList` based on user input. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can add more intelligent features!
    - **üóíÔ∏è Note**: You will need to create an account on OpenAI to get an API key.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality**: Is your code clean enough to see through like crystal clear waters?
- **Problem Solving**: Can you dive deep and bring solutions to the surface?
- **Innovation**: We love ideas that make waves. How creatively can you integrate and utilize AI?

## Submission

When you've completed your tasks, please submit a link to your repository to [youssef@acqua.ai](youssef@acqua.ai). Ensure your repository is public so our team can review your work.

Good luck, and may your coding be as fluid as the sea. We look forward to possibly welcoming you aboard the Acqua team!
